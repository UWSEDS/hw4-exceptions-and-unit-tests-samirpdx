    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will develop a function and related tests to manage downloaded data. You will use\n",
    "a technique that is very common in software engineering called *data caching*. You will implement two functions. Both\n",
    "have a single argument, a URL of a data you want to access. The first function, get_data, downloads the data if it\n",
    "is not present locally; if the data are already present, then it takes no action. The second function, delete_data, removes\n",
    "the data if it is present locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grading rubric is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctly implement get_data with an exception if the URL does not exist. (Hint: Try downloading the file using urllib3 instead of wget.) (2 pt)\n",
    "- Correctly implement remove_data (1/2 pt)\n",
    "- Implement tests for get_data that consider the following cases: (a) file is present locally; (b) file is not present locally, and the URL points to a file that exists; and (c) URL does not point to a file that exists. (2 pt)\n",
    "- Correctly implement tests for remove_data (1/2 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests should be in a separate file from the functions get_data and remove_data.\n"
